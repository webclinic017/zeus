# Lead Scoring Automation

After you've already extracted the profiles of target customers into entities, now you can use the labels and
metadata to generate lead scores, and then personalize an out-bound linkedIn message to the top leads.
Just iterate on linkedIn entities, score them in an analysis, use an auto-eval filter to take the top leads, and then
use an aggregation stage to personalize the message.
