    "description": "Zeusfyi provides advanced cloud technology solutions for all through our unified cloud platform of interconnected multi-cloud, multi-region Kubernetes clusters. We record keep all the config and infrastructure relationships in our Postgres database, and orchestrate resource provisioning and app deployment via\n\n our Zeus service. \n\n\n\n We don't care if you are a single developer working on a hobby project, or a Fortune 500 company. We care about solving your problems though, and empowering you with doing more for much less. \n\n\n\n We're remaking the cloud into a universal one, and unifying standards so that technology is seamless, even when providers are not. \n\n\n\nWe'll keep making the cloud easier to use until the cloud starts to build itself, and we are working on the latter."
