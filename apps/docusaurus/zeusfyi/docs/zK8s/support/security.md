# Security

Please email us at support@zeus.fyi if you have any questions, concerns, or feedback.

## External Service Types

There's currently two supported ways to expose services for Zeus orchestration.

## Service Accounts

These are essentially IAM roles for your services. You can create a service account that grants us
the minimum necessary privileges required to orchestrate your services on your behalf.

## API Gateway Middleware (aka Hades)

You can also use our API Gateway middleware to create a secure tunnel between your services and ours. Schedule
an expert and we'll help you get setup for free.
