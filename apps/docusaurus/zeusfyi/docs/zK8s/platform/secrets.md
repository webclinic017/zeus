# Secrets

## Intro

Our Secrets service is designed to provide a secure and efficient method of storing and managing your secrets while also 
allowing you to seamlessly integrate them into your applications. 

## AWS Secrets via Zeusfyi

We use AWS Secrets Manager to store your secrets and never write them to disk or store them in our database,
and follow best practices for security and encryption. See additional details in our Privacy Policy on our home site.

We'll store up to 1000 secrets for free, and then charge $0.50 per secret per month after that.
