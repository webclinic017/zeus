# Introduction

Mockingbird is a time series controlled AI systems coordinator & workflow executor system, data indexer and searcher,
that builds control loops and hierarchical planning rules around higher order goals & objectives using automated
evaluation systems and model-to-model communication via synchronized quorums. It is designed to be a general purpose
system that is eventually capable of becoming generally intelligent, and then super intelligent.

## Usage

Mockingbird is currently a model based supervisor entity, and soon, it will be a Model Supervised Intelligent Network,
and now a product you can use, like ChatGPT 4, but with power steering and cruise control.

## Costs

Mockingbird is free to use for the first 3 days, which starts once you add a cc and start your first workflow.
Though we may restrict account usage if we see abuse. If you connect your own OpenAI API key, you will be responsible
for any costs associated with that, otherwise we will use our API key and then charge you 1-to-1 for the cost of the API
usage that we incur, however you may have your usage throttled if you exceed our usage limits while using our API key.
