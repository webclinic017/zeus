# Overview

Mockingbird is a time series controlled AI systems coordinator & workflow executor system, data indexer and searcher,
that builds control loops and hierarchical planning rules around higher order goals & objectives using automated
evaluation systems and model-to-model communication via synchronized quorums. It is designed to be a general purpose
system that is eventually capable of becoming generally intelligent, and then super intelligent.

## Usage

Mockingbird is an active research and development project. We're allowing free public usage of a curated set of
features as we evaluate the system and build out the core functionality.

## Costs

Mockingbird is currently free to use for self-service features at this time. Though we may restrict account usage if we
see abuse. If you connect your own OpenAI API key, you will be responsible for any costs associated with that, otherwise
we will
use our API key and then charge you 1-to-1 for the cost of the API usage that we incur, however you may have your usage
throttled if you exceed our usage limits while using our API key.
