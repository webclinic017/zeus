# Overview

Mockingbird is a time series controlled AI coordination & orchestration system that builds control loops and
hierarchical planning rules
around higher order goals & objectives using automated evaluation systems and model-to-model communication via quorums.
It is designed to be a general purpose system that is eventually capable of becoming generally intelligent,
and then super intelligent.

## Usage

Mockingbird is an active in research and development project, that we're allowing public usage of a curated set of
features
as we evaluate the system and build out the core functionality.

## Features Available via Self Service UI

- Social Media Indexing (Twitter, Reddit, Discord)
- Retrievals (API, Social Media)
- Analysis/Aggregation Tasks
- Integrated Time Window Search by Aggregation Windows
- Single model-to-model communication
- Time series controlled AI workflows, with dynamic time step control
- Workflow + relationship builder (UI)
- Integrated OpenAI + Social integration APIs, natively via Platform Secrets
- Run Scheduler
- Run History + Results

## Features Available To Researchers & Partners

- Additional indexing sources (News, Blogs, Forums, etc)
- Adaptive time series control via Metrics + Evals (PromQL, Adaptive)
- Automated evaluation systems
- Multi-Model-Single-Model communication via quorums
- Multi-Modal (Text, Image, Video, Audio) analysis
