# Inputs/Outputs

For generic retrievals we recommend you setup an API that can be called from the load balancer group for quick starting.

## APIs via Load Balancer

It will get data from each route in the load balancer group you reference here and then aggregate the results into a
single response.

The website extraction and keywords feature is still in development, but coming soon you'll be able to use it, but you
can save instructions for now and it will be available in the future for you to update your retrievals.

See the RPC Load Balancer Documentation for adding routes, and creating routing groups that you can use here.
