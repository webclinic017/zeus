# Intro

The builder section allows you to build tasks (analysis, aggregation), retrievals, evals, and more from the UI and
then mix and match them to quickly create new workflows, which is ideal for rapid prototyping and experimentation.
We tried to keep things as simple as possible to use via the UI to make it as accessible as possible. Let us know if
anything is confusing or you have any questions.
