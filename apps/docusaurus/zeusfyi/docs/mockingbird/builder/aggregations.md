# Aggregations

Use this to tell the AI how to aggregate the results of your analysis chunks into a rolling aggregation window. If
aggregating on a single analysis, the aggregation cycle count sets how many base analysis cycles to aggregate on. If
aggregating on multiple analysis, it will aggregate whenever the the underlying analysis is run.
