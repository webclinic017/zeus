# Enterprise

Contact us at support@zeus.fyi for a quote.

We have purely usage based pricing, as well as options which allow you to use
a private version of our load balancer + Redis + anvil/hardhat servers that works
with internal endpoints that can be setup in 1-click and allows full functionality like caching directly.

You can also chain our load balancer with workloads in Kubernetes using it for managing any traffic scenario,
well and far beyond only web3 applications. We use it to manage our own traffic internally using headless services
that we manage with our load balancer directly instead of the embedded Round Robin one.
