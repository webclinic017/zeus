## Introducing Serverless EVMs
Foundry’s Anvil as an EVM Simulation Environment on Demand.

Democratizing access to simulation technology at scale  by lowering the cost of simulation to near zero.
For safer smart contracts, less exploits, more robust engineering by using isolated ephemeral environments per each test.

## Adaptive RPC Load Balancer Benchmarks
Over several weeks on a production load monitoring Uniswap prices

When should you consider using the Adaptive RPC Load Balancer?​

TLDR:
- You need to scale your application to handle more requests than a single endpoint can handle
- You need to reduce the error rate of your application
- Especially if you are still paying for the request even if it fails
- You need to improve the reliability of your application
- You want to run multi-step procedures in a single request

#### API Endpoints 

Documentation and code examples are found here
[API_README.md](https://github.com/zeus-fyi/zeus/blob/main/pkg/zeus/API_README.md)

How to use the test suite to setup your own api calls
[README.md](https://github.com/zeus-fyi/zeus/blob/main/pkg/zeus/README.md)

The test directory contains useful mocks and tools for interacting with the API. It also contains a useful
config-sample.yaml, convert this to config.yaml and set your bearer token here, which then allows you to
use the demo code to create your first api request in seconds

## Overview

1. Automates translation of kubernetes yaml configurations into representative SQL models
2. Users upload these infrastructure configurations via API where they are stored in the DB
3. Users can then query the contents of these infrastructure components, deploy, mutate or destroy them on demand
   
### Currently Supported Workload Types

1. Deployments
2. StatefulSets
3. Services
4. ConfigMaps
5. Ingresses
6. ServiceMonitors
7. Secrets

+ Node Tainting Automation & Infra Provisioning (Servers & SSDs) Deployable & Scalable on Demand.

### Pods Controller 

1. GetPods
2. GetPodLogs
3. PortforwardReqToPods
4. DeletePods

Not every possible field type is supported, but the most common ones are, and even a decent amount of the uncommon ones. If you find a field you need isn't supported please send us an email at support@zeus.fyi

### Hades Library

Hades is used to interact with Kubernetes workloads via API, and can apply saved Zeus workloads & cookbooks onto your
own in house infrastructure.

### Hera Client

This client uses the OpenAI API to generate code with AI. This service is available at OpenAI cost, so just pay for the
token cost, otherwise it is free to use.

## Cookbooks ##

Contains common web2 & web3 recipes for deploying applications, and managing infrastructure using zK8s or vanilla
Kubernetes.
